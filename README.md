# Level 1 mobile app UX project + development of simple applications.
## Unit: COS30017
I developed simple Android apps such as a calculator app and a travel journal. My final project was the level 1 project. Where I developed a prototype for the applications using app UX principles and then completed a competitive analysis of the prototype for a similar application.
